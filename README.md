# Global Pollution-Energy Index

This repository contains the necessary information and work for the 2024 spring semester Senior Thesis of Anthony Vazquez for the Allegheny College Integrative Informatics Department. 

Additionally, in order to view the web version of this project, click the link [here.](https://global-pollution-energy-index.streamlit.app/)

You should see a home screen that looks like this:

![Fig 1: Snapshot from Home Page of the Global Pollution-Energy Index](images/homepage.jpeg)

From this home page, you will see an overview of what the website is about and some of the goals that it has. There are also informational videos at the top and bottom of this page, you can view them by clicking the checkbox:

Once you have read through the first page and watched any videos, you can move onto the next page, which is Emissions by Decade for the years 1750-2020.

That page should look like this:

![Fig 3: Snapshot from Emissions by Decade page of the Global Pollution-Energy Index](images/emissionsdec.jpeg)

There is plenty of information on this page, and it is also interesting to watch the emissions rise at certain times within a century, especially when one can relate the rise or fall in emissions to a real-world event.

Once this page has been viewed, you can start learning about Pollution and Energy:

Each of the pages labeled 'P&E' or 'Pollution & Energy' have relatively the same layout, so only showing one here gives the user an idea of what to expect for each instance. There will be a topic paragraph, usually followed by a video or two, and after that is a more in-depth description of the topic that is then followed by more informational videos on the subject.

Once the user is finished running the program, they can hold the control key, and press the 'c' key with it, this will stop running the program. Then, the user can exit out of the window for the website as well.
